# Family Time

This repository contains all code related to my Master's Thesis Project 2020 at NYU ITP.

## Run Commands
To run a session on a remote Raspberry Pi, execute the run.sh script with:
> ./run.sh

To bind a client to an ongoing session, use the attach.sh script with:
>./attach.sh

Both of the previous scripts use "byobu", a terminal multiplexer that allows me to run a script, close my terminal and come back to it still running.

## Project Documentation
In this repo you'll only find the code for the home device. The creative process, the "why" of this project can be found here:
